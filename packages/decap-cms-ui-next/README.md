# Decap CMS UI Next

This package contains the default UI elements that are used in Decap CMS.

_This specific package contains breaking changes from Decap CMS 3.x._

Part of the 4.0 update is a UI overhaul. This means that the `decap-cms-ui-default` package contains the 3.0 styling.
This `decap-cms-ui-next` package is entirely new, and contains the styles, and components for the new UI.
